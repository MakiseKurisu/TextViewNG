              A note about redistribution of modified versions.

While I use a traditional BSD license for this program, I have an additional
requirement for those who want to produce their own modified versions of
the software. Modified versions must not be named "Haali Reader", and
should have your own coordinates in the About box and accompanying
documentation along with a note stating that the program is based on Haali Reader.
Having such a note somewhere in the distribuition is required by the
license agreement anyway.
