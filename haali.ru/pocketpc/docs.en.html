<h4>Main screen</h4>
The main window consists of the text pane, the progress bar and the menu/toolbar.
Drag the stylus over the text pane to select text, use Tools-&gt;Copy to
copy the selected text to the clipboard. Tap text to perform dictionary lookup
(if "use dictionary" is selected in general options). While in dictionary mode
you can enter words directly into the main window to perform word lookup.
Double tap any whitespace to toggle fullscreen mode. Tap on the progress bar moves the current
position in the document. Tap on the small arrows at the ends of the progress
bar moves current position to the next/previous contents item. Toolbar
buttons provide shortcut access to the following menu items in order from
left to right: Back, Forward, Contents, Add bookmark, Find, Find next, Copy.<br>
<br>
<h4>Menus</h4>

documents this will probably be a tree of parts and sections, for plain text
documents a simplistic algorithm is used to detect chapter headings. Bookmarks
are inserted into the tree according to their position in the document. These

Options</big></b><br>
  <ul>
    <li><big>Fullscreen </big>- toggle fullscreen mode (turns off title bar
and toolbar).</li>
    <li><big>File format</big> - select file format from the following list:
Auto, Line per paragraph, Indented first line, MAC line per paragraph, MAC
indented first line, XML. The first five deal with different formatting of
plain text documents, MAC variants are available for files which use \r (0x0d)
as end of line markers instead of traditional \n or \r\n. File encoding can
also be selected from the encodings available in your windows version. HaaliReader
has five builtin encodings that are always available: windows-1252 (a superset
of iso-8859-1), windows-1251, cp866, koi8-r - these are cyrillic encodings,
and utf-8 for unicode texts.</li>
    <li><big>Display </big>- set various text display options. The top part
of the dialog is used to select the base font for the text. At the botom
there are input boxes for ajusting side margins and the botom margin, display
rotation and selecting the number of columns on screen (this is handy for
HPCs which have a wide screen). Use soft hyphens checkbox turns on the builtin
hyphenation module for russian language.</li>
    <li><big>Colors </big>- allows the user to adjust the colors of the interfaces
elements. Various highlight items work together with the Styles dialog and
are only useful for rendering XML documents.</li>
    <li><big>Styles </big>- select format to use for each XML style / tag.
Style is specified as a modifier to main font selection.</li>
    <li><big>Buttons </big>- assign function to hardware buttons and if present
keyboard buttons. Use grab key to assign funtions to hardware buttons. Hardware
buttons are released back to the operating system when HaaliReader's window
loses focus.&nbsp;If rotate is mapped to a hardware button, screen is rotated
90 degrees anti-clockwise.</li>
    <li><big>Dictionaries </big>- add, remove, view HaaliReader dictionaries.
Dictionary should be in .DIC format (see mkdict tool on how to make a custom
dictionary). Only one active dictionary is used for word lookup, to change
the active dictionary select it in the list and tap OK button. </li>
    <li><big>General </big>- adjust all other propram's options. Use dictionary
checkbox specifies wheter single taps in the main window should cause word
lookup, rotate buttons tells the program to swap functions of the cursor
control buttons when the display orientation chages. File buffer size specifies
the amount of file data cached in memory, can set it to some high value if
you read books from a microdrive to avoid frequent access to the storage
device. The
last input field specifies how many most recently opened files are tracked
in the registry. &nbsp;Bookmarks are also stored in the registry. </li>
  </ul>

<h4>Keyboard reference </h4>
Accelerator keys that are not present in the buttons dialog:<br>
<br>
Control-C - Copy<br>
Control-O - Open<br>
Control-F - Find<br>
Control-G, Control-3, F3 - Find next<br>
Control-Q - Exit<br>
Alt-Left - Back<br>
Alt-Right - Forward<br>
<br>
F2 - edit bookmark in the contents dialog<br>
<br>
File position specification can be entered directly into the main window.
Use following format: &lt;number&gt;% to
move to certain percentage, or &lt;number&gt;= to move to a certain paragraph.<br>
In regexp terms: <code>([0-9]+)([;:][0-9]+)?([lLpP%=gG])</code><br>
When $3 is p, P, %: move to $1 percentage into the document<br>
When $3 is l, L: move to a virtual page $1 (virtual page is 2048 charactes long)<br>
When $3 is =, g, G: move to paragraph $1, character $2<br>
<br>
When dictionary view is active, word lookup can be performed by entering text into
the main window. A temporary panel in shown with the entered text, and a dictionary
lookup is attempted as you enter text. Tab key clears the input panel, unfortunately,
the default input method in PocketPC/PsPC systems doesn't include the escape key, so I
had to choose something else to cancel current input.
