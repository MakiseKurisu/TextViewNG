and toolbar).</li>
    <li><big>File format</big> - select file format from the following list:
Auto, Line per paragraph, Indented first line, MAC line per paragraph, MAC
indented first line, XML. The first five deal with different formatting of
plain text documents, MAC variants are used for files which use \r (0x0d)
as end of line markers instead of traditional \n or \r\n. File encoding can
also be select from the encodings available in your windows version. HaaliReader
has five builtin encodings that are always available: windows-1252 (a superset
of iso-8859-1), windows-1251, cp866, koi8-r - these are cyrillic encodings,
and utf-8 for unicode texts.</li>

of the dialog is used to select the base font for the text. At the botom
there are input boxes for ajusting side margins and the botom margin, display

HPCs which have a wide screen). Use soft hyphens checkbox turns on the builtin
hyphenation module for russian language.</li>
    <li><big>Colors </big>- allows the user to adjust the colors of the interfaces
elements. Various highlight items work together with the Styles dialog and
are only useful for rendering XML documents.</li>
    <li><big>Styles </big>- select format to use for each XML style / tag.
Style is specified as a modifier to main font selection.</li>
    <li><big>Buttons </big>- assign function to hardware buttons and if present
keyboard buttons. Use grab key to assign funtions to hardware buttons. Hardware
buttons are released back to the operating system when HaaliReader's window
loses focus.&nbsp;If rotate is mapped to a hardware button, screen is rotated
90 degrees anti-clockwise.</li>
    <li><big>Dictionaries </big>- add, remove, view HaaliReader dictionaries.
Dictionary should be in .DIC format (see mkdict tool on how to make a custom
dictionary). Only one active dictionary is used for word lookup, to change

dictionary can also be selected from the menu in the dictionary dialog.</li>
    <li><big>General </big>- adjust all other propram's options. Use dictionary
checkbox specifies wheter single taps in the main window should cause word

control buttons when the display orientation chages. File buffer size specifies
the amount of file data cached in memory, can set it to some high value if
you read books from a microdrive to avoid frequent access to the storage
device. Save bookmarks directly to XML files is an experimental option that
stores bookmarks at the end of XML files as processing instructions. The
last input field specifies how many most recently opened files are tracked
in the registry. &nbsp;Bookmarks are also stored in the registry. </li>
