TextViewNG
==========

TextViewNG is an advanced text viewer.

              A note about redistribution of modified versions.

While I use a traditional BSD license for this program, I have an additional
requirement for those who want to produce their own modified versions of the
software. Modified versions must not be named "Haali Reader" or "TextViewNG",
and should have your own coordinates in the About box and accompanying
documentation along with a note stating that the program is based on Haali
Reader and TextViewNG. Having such a note somewhere in the distribuition is
required by the license agreement anyway.
